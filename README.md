Statistical Analysis of Social Networks

# Summary
This is an introduction to statistical analysis of networks. While no strict prerequisites are assumed, you might find it helpful to have some basic knowledge of social network analysis beforehand. To benefit fully from the course requires a basic knowledge of standard statistical methods, such regression analysis. The course aims to give a basic understanding of and working handle on drawing inference for structure and attributes, both cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. A fundamental notion of the course will be how the structure of observed graphs relate to various forms of random graphs. This will be developed in the context of non-parametric approaches and elaborated to analysis of networks using exponential random graph models (ERGM) and stochastic actor-oriented models. The main focus will be on explaining structure but an outlook to explaining individual-level outcomes will be provided.

The participant will be provided with several hands-on exercises, applying the approaches to a suite of real world data sets. We will use the stand-alone graphical user interface package MPNet and R. In R we will learn how to use the packages ‘sna’, ‘statnet’, and ‘RSiena’. No familiarity with R is assumed but preparatory exercises will be provided ahead of the course.
